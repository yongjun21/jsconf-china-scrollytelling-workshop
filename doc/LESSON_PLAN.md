### Intro
- Short intro of myself, my work, and the graphics team work within a media organization (~15min)
- Intro to using scroll as an UI/UX component (~5min)
    - Why is it effective
    - How has it been applied to enhance UI/UX
    - Examples

### Start of hands-on
#### Part 1: Building a simple but reusable scrolly component (~50min)

- Sticky background / foreground (~10min)
- Triggers / Scenes / Slides - Let the app structure dictates trigger placement (~30min)
- Enter & Exit - Gradual transition (~20min)
- Progress tracking (~10min)

#### Part 3: Using our scrolly component to build a scrollytelling visual story (~30min)
- Pre-built story components will be provided
- Pre-built scrolly component will be provided in case participant did not manage to follow in earlier parts
